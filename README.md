# sasnpy
SASnPy is a component that facilitates the use of Python from Base SAS. 

To use the component, simply download and extract/unzip the package zip file of the bitness matching the bitness of Base SAS (sasnpy-32bit.zip for 32-bit Base SAS and sasnpy-64bit.zip for 64-bit Base SAS).

The package file consists of 5 files:

* sasnpy.sas
* sasnpy.dll
* sasnpy.py
* sasnpy.html
* settings.xml

All the files should be present in the same folder for SASnPy to function properly.  The "Examples" folder contains example SAS and Python files that demonstrate various features of the SASnPy component.
